         <p> My name is Ian Jericho Pedeglorio. I am from Baguio CIty, Philippines and I migrated to Canada in 2019. I am now based in Regina, Saskatchewan. I am currently on my last year as a computer 
           science student at the University of Regina. My fields of interest are Embedded C Programming with IoT application, Web Development and Cloud Computing. I also teach kids how to code as a volunteer code instructor with YesWecode by Hakili Community for Sustainable Development. Outside of coding,
           my hobbies are photography, videography and travel.
